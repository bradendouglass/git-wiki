-----------------
Page Links: linking, like in many wikis, is performed by
using CamelCase words. This makes life tricky since many
modules and classes in Ruby are CamelCase. To escape a
word from auto linking, surround it in {{ }} or "squirrely"
brackets.

Page and Title Names: The page title and name was
tied to the name of the markdown file. This was changed
to break up CamelCasing. However, if you write "USABrief" then
the title and the H1 tag will read "U S A Brief". Just make
sure to have a lowercase character between each uppercase
char. This adds to readability and still allows the file
names to be grep-able.
